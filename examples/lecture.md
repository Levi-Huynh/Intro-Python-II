# Q to think about classes: 
-when would you break up something to sublcass of that class
 versus make a field attribute for it

-sub class of animals
-- child class based on parent class, but adding things
specific to that subclass type (robot), make_sound, color, version

-1 class can `inherit` attributes from other classes 

-1 class can have other clases in it.. called `composition`

-enumurate basically takes an array & turns it into sub arrays :
[run, book, base] => [(0,run), (1,book), (2,base)]

for i, category in enumerate(self.categories)
#1. running
2 . basketball 
print(i, category)

or..

i =1
for category in self.categories:
print(i, category)
output = see code
i+=1
